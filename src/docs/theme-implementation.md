# Medical Website Theme Implementation Documentation

## Step 1: Define Theme Types

In this step, we extended the theme types to support multiple medical specialty themes:

- Added `ThemeSpecialty` type with options: 'default', 'organTransplant', and 'cosmeticSurgery'
- Created new type definitions for theme components:
  - `ThemeColors`: Defines color palette for each theme including primary, secondary, accent, etc.
  - `ThemeTypography`: Defines typography settings including font family and styles
  - `ThemeSpacing`: Defines spacing scale for consistent layout
  - `ThemeBorderRadius`: Defines border radius variations
  - `ThemeConfig`: Combines all theme components
- Extended the main `Theme` interface to include:
  - `specialty`: To identify which medical specialty theme is active
  - `config`: To hold the theme-specific styling configuration

These types will be used throughout the application to maintain consistent theming across different medical specialties while preserving the existing theme functionality for direction, mode, and layout.

### Implementation Details
File modified: `src/@types/theme.ts`

Next steps will involve creating theme configurations for each medical specialty and updating the theme store to support switching between themes.

## Step 2: Create Zustand Theme Store

In this step, we updated the Zustand theme store to support multiple medical specialty themes:

1. Extended the theme store to track the current theme specialty ('default', 'organTransplant', 'cosmeticSurgery')
2. Added a new `setSpecialty` action to change the active theme
3. Configured the store to persist theme selection in localStorage
4. Created specialty theme configurations for each medical specialty:
   - Default theme: Blue color scheme for general medical practice
   - Organ Transplant theme: Teal color scheme representing medical specialization
   - Cosmetic Surgery theme: Pink/Purple color scheme emphasizing aesthetics

The updated theme store now properly handles theme switching and persistence, allowing users to maintain their theme preference across sessions.

### Implementation Details
Files modified:
- `src/store/themeStore.ts`: Updated with specialty support and persistence
- `src/configs/specialty-themes.config.ts`: Created to define theme configurations for each specialty

Next steps will involve implementing a theme selection interface to allow users to switch between different medical specialty themes.
